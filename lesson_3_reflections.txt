When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
 local?
If I'd like to present my work for anybody or share with somebody, I will use the
 remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I want to be aware what I'm showing to people and be able to show what I've decided, 
not everything.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

The branch is an alternate (experimental) version of my project. Clone stands for 
copying from remote location (GitHub) or local folder to another local folder. Fork is
 a special version of clonning which exists on GitHub only - clonning from one GitHub 
 repo to another one GitHub repo.   

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored
 locally?
 - We can resolve conflicts between local and remote repo.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? 
What would be easier, and what would be harder?
- It would be much harder becase we need to keep track of changes and versions and
exchange files with changes manually.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly 
in master? What benefits does each approach have?

- A separate branch means new experiments with source files of main branch. You are
free to experiment knowing that you main source code is safe.
