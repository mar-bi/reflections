What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- Git adds .git file to initialized folder and waits for an initial commit.
-I start to use version control system for this directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

- Staging area is a halfway from working directory to repo: files you plan to commit
you add first there, then can decide to add more or remove some of them.
- It is temporary location of files. It gives you time to rethink your decision.
