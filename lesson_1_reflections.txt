How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
 was introduced?
 - viewing the difference helps me to check for typo or mistakes and reminds me 
 where did i do changes last time, when the program, file, or app behaved as expected.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?
- I don't need to create a new separate version file everytime I did a serious 
change to my code and ,moreover, remember all these changes. (It is impossible for me).

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
 commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
- I can mention just 1 small cons of manually choosen commit - I can easy forget
to do the commit being kept by a workflow.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple 
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A Repository means all files are for one project. In order to make project work,
you should control saves in all included files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
- Git Log shows me commits that have been done. I can pick 2 consequtive commits and 
check the difference between them, which reflects me changes.


// I want a new laptop with Ubuntu!!!

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that 
could break something?
- Using Git checkout helps me to find the first introduction of the bug and roll back 
to the previous (this-bug-free version).

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
- I want to finish and upload my portfolio page.
